üìÅ Project Structure
Folder Structure Explanation
Unlike traditional multi-tiered applications with separate backend, frontend, and database directories, CyberGuard AI is implemented as a single-file Python application using Streamlit. This monolithic structure consolidates all functionalities‚ÄîUI, business logic, AI integration, and database interactions‚Äîinto one file (app.py). Below is a detailed breakdown of the logical structure within this single file and any supporting elements:
1. Main Application File (app.py)
‚Ä¢	Purpose: Central entry point containing all code for the web interface, AI processing, database operations, and utility functions.
‚Ä¢	Structure Within the File:
o	Imports: Includes essential Python libraries (streamlit, google.generativeai, speech_recognition, supabase, etc.).
o	Configuration: Defines hardcoded configuration variables for Supabase (URL and key), SMTP (email settings), and Google Gemini API key.
o	Function Definitions:
ÔÇß	generate_cybercrime_tips: Generates safety tips using Gemini AI.
ÔÇß	send_confirmation_email: Sends email notifications with complaint details and tips.
ÔÇß	recognize_speech: Handles speech-to-text conversion with retry logic.
ÔÇß	get_gemini_response: Interacts with the Gemini API for text and file processing.
ÔÇß	categorize_complaint: Performs AI-driven complaint categorization with detailed prompting.
ÔÇß	process_chatbot_input: Manages chatbot interactions and form data collection.
ÔÇß	dashboard: Defines the main UI logic and page navigation.
o	Session State Initialization: Uses init_session_state to manage application state (e.g., chat_history, form_data).
o	UI and Logic: Handles authentication, page rendering, and user interactions via Streamlit components.
‚Ä¢	Role: Acts as both backend and frontend, leveraging Streamlit‚Äôs server-side rendering.
